This repository contains material for the Python for Neuroscience course.
The materials include classes, some assignments and other useful information.
As a student of the course, you should star and watch it (top-right corner) to receive
notifications when I update it with new material.

Homework assignments, excluding the first one, will be presented in different repositories,
but the lectures themselves reside here. They're named `classX.ipynb` and are viewable in GitHub,
and editable and runnable with Jupyter Notebook.

If you come across any useful learning resources which are not listed in `Resources.md`,
please don't hesitate to create a pull request with the new resource you found.

## Homework Assignments:

* Assignment 1 - the assignment is described in the `assignments/assignments1`. Grades were handed out as issues in your repos.
* Assignment 2 - Click [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/Lk_aw7SK) to open the repo. _Deadline:_ April 1st, 2019, 15:00.
* Assignment 3 - Click [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/c22J_eQk) to open the repo. _Deadline:_ April 15th, 2019, 15:00.

## Hackathon

The course's final project will be completed during a hackathon orchestrated by the Sagol school. A list of projects will be created later on this semester, and each student will assign him or herself to a project.

**We're currently considering the 19-20.6 as the dates for the hackathon. Please tell me if you have any conflicting tests or other obligations during these dates.**
